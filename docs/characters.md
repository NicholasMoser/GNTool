## Fix Kabuto 2A Scaling for Player 2

When playing as Kabuto on the player 1 side, Kabuto does unscaled damage with 2A. On the player 2 side however,
this damage is scaled. Player 1 unscaled damage is 48, while player 2 scaled damage is 26. Using this fix in
GNTool will use unscaled damage for both player 1 and player 2.

## Fix Phantom Sword for Kisame Player 2

When playing as Kisame on the player 1 side, you can make JA **unblockable** by landing with it on a specific frame;
this is called Phantom Sword. Kisame on the player 2 side is unable to perform Phantom Sword. Using this fix in
GNTool will allow player 2 to also perform Phantom Sword.

## Fix Phantom Sword for Zabuza Player 2

When playing as Zabuza on the player 1 side, you can make JA **unblockable** by landing with it on a specific frame;
this is called Phantom Sword. Zabuza on the player 2 side is unable to perform Phantom Sword. Using this fix in
GNTool will allow player 2 to also perform Phantom Sword.
