# Changed and Missing Files

The **Changed Files** tab contains the list of files you or GNTool have modified in the `uncompressed` directory. These files will be recompressed and moved upon building an ISO from the **File** menu. You can also right click on any changed files in the **Changed Files** view to open them, open their directory, or revert the changes.

The **Missing Files** tab contains the list of files that have been removed from the `uncompressed` directory. You will only be allowed to build with missing files if you allow GNTool to create 1 KB empty files as a replacement for them.
